    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        I love the corn dogs you buy at carnivals but wanted to make them 
        at home so I created this easy batter for frankfurters. Great served with mustard.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup yellow cornmeal</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 quart vegetable oil for frying</li>
        <li>2 (16 ounce) packages beef frankfurters</li>
        <li>16 wooden skewers</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Combine cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and pepper in a 
            medium bowl; stir in milk and egg to make a batter.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F 
            (190 degrees C). Meanwhile, pat frankfurters dry and insert a skewer into each one. 
            Roll frankfurters in batter until well coated.
        </li>
        <li>
            Fry 2 or 3 corn dogs at a time in preheated oil until lightly browned, about 3 
            minutes. Drain on paper towels.
        </li>
    </ol>
