        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This easy grilled cheese sandwich has a crispy Parmesan crust and a gooey Cheddar and bacon filling,
            and is simply the best I've ever had! As far as grilled cheese goes, this is it!
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Butter</b>: Â¼ cup of softened butter.</li>
            <li><b>Cheese</b>: 1 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese and 4 slices of Cheddar cheese.</li>
            <li><b>Bacon</b>: 8 slices of cooked bacon.</li>
            <li><b>Bread</b>: 8 slices of sourdough bread.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                In a small bowl, mash together the butter and Parmesan cheese until evenly blended.
                Make sandwiches by placing two slices of bacon and one slice of Cheddar cheese on
                half of the bread slices. Top with the remaining slices of bread.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Spread some of the butter mixture on the top
                of each sandwich. Place sandwiches butter side down in the skillet. Spread the remaining
                butter mixture on the other sides. Cook until golden brown on each side, about 3 minutes
                per side. To serve, cut in half diagonally.
